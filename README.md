## Introduction

This repository compiles my personal Data Science projects and experiments, ranging from classic machine learning models to deep learning and artificial intelligence. Many projects are inspired by or adapted from leading online courses (Udacity, Coursera), as well as participation in Kaggle competitions and practical classroom exercises.

Here, you'll find:
- End-to-end solutions for real-world problems.
- Step-by-step tutorials and code for various algorithms.
- Notebook-based explorations and visualizations.
- Materials and presentations used in Data Science classes and workshops.

## Repository Structure
